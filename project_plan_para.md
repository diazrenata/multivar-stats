Hi Ben,

I'm hoping I can use my final project as a chance to clear up a question we have about the plant & rodent timeseries data from Portal. Erica's work turned up a reorganization event in the rodent data that we can't immediately account for with a pronounced *climate* event, and one thought was that something happened with the plant community that might have driven changes in the rodents. There are some complicating factors - we haven't really talked about using the methods we've seen in class on timeseries data, and there's of course potential for feedbacks between the plant and rodent communities - but I'm thinking of using RDA or something similar to see if there's a signal of plant community composition on rodent community composition. If it's really not tractable to use the methods from class for this question, I'm more than happy to figure out something else using the Portal data or another dataset (probably something on rodent community patterns from NEON and/or a rodent database I've been pulling together...).

There are 24 plots (with different experimental treatments), but I would probably combine within treatments and adjust for sampling effort, so there would be a single value for each experimental treatment per census. We have 35 summer and 36 winter censuses of the plants (the communities are largely distinct, because there are two wet seasons), with 152 summer species and 161 winter species. We know there are a few hyperabundant plant species, so I will most likely filter those out. I would probably combine the monthly rodent censuses into 6-month totals, to correspond to the plant censuses. There are 18 species in the rodent granivore community.

Looking forward to chatting with you about this in lab!

Cheers, Renata
