## Project plan

1. Get data
    a. load Portal rodent and plant data
    b. summarize by year
    c. standardize according to trapping/survey effort
2. Reduce dimensionality of plant data
    a. try LDA
        1. If base LDA doesn't work, try removing 5% most/least common species
    b. pcoa
    c. separate winter/summer censuses a priori?
3. Distance based redundancy analysis
    a. try to use plant summary axes to predict rodent community
    b. (?) Use LDA rodent topics as ind variable?
4. Variance partitioning to isolate effects of year, plants on rodents
